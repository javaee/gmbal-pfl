/** Indicates that a class has already been enhanced for tracing.
 * There are currently two stages, and a class may be enhanced to either
 * stage=1 or stage=2.  stage=1 means that all class-schema changes have
 * taken place, and the static initializer has been modified to register
 * with the tracing facility, but none of the traceable methods have been
 * modified.  stage=2 includes all stage 1 changes, plus all tracing code 
 * has been added.
 * <p>
 * The reason for 2 stages is that stage 1 must be done at build time, while
 * stage 2 can be done either at build time, or dynmically, for example in a 
 * ClassFileTransformer.  It is extremely helpful if EnhanceTool knows whether
 * a class has already been enhanced, so it can avoid making a mess by 
 * enhancing a class multiple times.  This is also necessary for incremental
 * enhancement when a project is recompiled: only those classes that have been
 * recompiled will be enhanced again.
