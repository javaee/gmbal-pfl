    // sure that after the copy, source and dest have the same attributes,
    // but whenever an attribute is set either in the source or the dest, it
    // is not visible to the other node.  We do this by making both the
    // source and the dest point to the same delegate, which carries the 
    // attributes originally present in the source.  This happens in 3 parts:
    // 1. The preCopy method is invoked, which introduces a new delegate in the
    //    source object, which carries the sources old delegate and attributes.
    // 2. During the copy, the destination object's delegate points to the source object.
    // 3. After the copy, the destination object's delegate is moved to the source 
    //    object's delegate in the postCopy method.
    // At this point, the source and dest share the same delegate, which contains the
    // original attributes of the source object.  Any set calls on either the 
    // source or dest will allocate a new attributes objects, which will be used for
    // all attribute setting.

    // This method is invoked on the source before the copy.  If the 
    // source has attributes, this causes the source to delegate to a new
    // AttributedObjectBase object which has the attributes that the source
    // originally had.  The source ends up having a delegate but no attributes.
