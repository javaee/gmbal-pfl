    // Copying of tree nodes deserves some discussion here.
    // The basic issue is that we must always make sure that the
    // AST is really a tree, and not a DAG.  This is necessary
    // because each Node in the AST has dynamic attributes, and we
    // cannot allow the situation where a Visitor traversing the
    // tree would attempt to set conflicting dynamic attribute values
    // when visiting a Node from different paths.
    //
    // To avoid this problem, we make sure that every Node that is 
    // added to the AST as an ordinary java field is first copied
    // before it is added to the tree.  Being a lazy programmer,
    // I do not want to write clone methods or copy constructors on
    // every different subclass of Node in the AST representation.
    // Since we already have a reflective copier in the ORB, I want to
    // re-use that.  But it does not quite do the right thing.  In particular,
    // the default copier would traverse the parent of each Node, which means
    // that effectively every time we copy a node, we copy the entire AST,
    // leading to extreme memory consumption (perhaps quadratic or worse in AST size).
    //
    // To avoid this, we need some way of controlling exactly how AST nodes are 
    // copied.  The CopyInterceptor interface and Copy annotation provide a lot
    // of flexibility for the object copier.  Here we just need to make sure that the
    // parent is NOT traversed, so that the copy and the original just share
    // the same parent.
