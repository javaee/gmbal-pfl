/** Implementation of FacetAccessor that delegates to another FacetAccessor,
 * typically a FacetAccessorImpl.  The purpose of this call is to provide
 * a convenient template of methods that may be copied into a class that
 * implements FacetAccessor.  Typically such a class implements that
 * FacetAccessor interface and defines a data member initialized as:
 * 
 * FacetAccessor facetAccessorDelegate = new FacetAccessorImpl( this ) ;
 * 
 * and then simply copies the other methods directly.
 * 
 * This is all a workaround for the fact that Java does not
 * support dynamic inheritance, or more than one superclass.  
 * 
 * Because this is a template, I have commented out all of the code.
 * It is not used at runtime or compiletime.
