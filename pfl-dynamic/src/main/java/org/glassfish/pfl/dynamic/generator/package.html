      This package defines a facility that can be used to enhance Java interfaces
      and abstract classes with properties and delegation.  Delegation only
      applies to abstract classes, since a class must contain non-static
      data members to support delegation.

      An interface or abstract class that contains at least one abstract method
      annotated &#64;Value or at least one field annotated &#64;Delegate is a client
      class.  The resulting implementation produced automatically as described
      below is the enhanced class.

      All properties are read-only and all delegates are set in the constructor.
      Writable properties are generally a bad idea, and indicate a poor design.
      Dynamic delegation is potentially very useful, but not really in keeping
      with the static nature of Java interfaces.  It also raises complex
      synchronization questions which probably cannot be handled by a general
      framework.

      Annotations used:
        &#64;Value: defines a property accessor method (optional value representing
            ID, default is derived from method name)
        &#64;Delegate: defines a data member used to handle all methods on an
            implemented interface (optional value representing ID,
            default is field name)
        &#64;Factory: used on a class that contains abstract methods that
            are annotated as &#64;Builder with return type matching the
            value of the &#64;Factory annotation (required Class value that
            gives the client class for which &#64;Builder methods are supplied.
        &#64;Builder: used on a method of a &#64;Factory class
            that acts as a builder for an enhanced
            class.  Builders may also be enhanced. (optional String[]
            value mapping builder value ids to enhanced class value
            or delegate ids).
        &#64;Id: used on a parameter in a builder method to indicate what
            id in the result the parameter value initializes.
            (required String value parameter).

      The key point in all of this is how to create instances of classes that
      use delegation and properties.  Initializing a delegate or initializing
      a property value takes place when the enhanced class is constructed.
      We can have generic methods to do this, or explicit constructors.
      A builder (a factory class, or a limited meta-class) may itself
      use property and delegation facilities in order to construct its target.

      Interface case:
      - All we really need in the generated class is a constructor that takes
        a Map&lt;String,Object&gt; as an argument.

      Abstract class case:
      - This is more complex.  It would seem to make sense to require that for
        each constructor in the client class, there is a corresponding constructor
        in the enhanced class, which takes a Map&lt;String,Object&gt; as an extra argument
        (probably at the end of the arg list). The implementation just calls
        super on the correspding parent class constructor, and then uses the
        Map&lt;String,Object&gt; to initialize the delegates and values.

      So we need a way to indicate that a particular method in a builder class
      can be used to initialize a particular delegate or property value in
      the builder's target class.  We can do this by property ID.  For example,
      the &#64;Builder annotation can have a String[] value, in which each element
      takes the form

      "(bid)-&gt;(ecid)"

      where bid is an id for a value in the builder, and ecid is an id
      for a value or delegate in the enhanced class.

      Basic dynamic initialization:
      Object create( Pair&lt;String,Object&gt;... )
      Object create( Map&lt;String,Object&gt; )
      Here the map key/first element is either a String (for a Value) or
      a Class (for a Delegate).

      How does a builder method work?
      A builder method is any abstract method in a &#64;Builder class that returns
      the type of the &#64;Builder annotation value.  The interesting problem here
      is how to pick an appropriate constructor to use.  Basic idea:
      - all parameters NOT annotated with &#64;Id must match a particular constructor.
      - all ID parameters are used to create a Map&lt;String,Object&gt; that is
        passed to the corresponding derived constructor in the enhanced class.
