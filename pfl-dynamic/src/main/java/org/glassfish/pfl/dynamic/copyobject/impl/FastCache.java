/** A cache intended to help speed up access to a Map.
 * The idea is that some maps have a few values that are retrieved
 * more frequently than others.  So, we create a fixed size array
 * that holds keys and values, and do a very fast hash on the key's
 * identityHashCode.  The cache is backed by a map, which can be
 * an IdentityHashMap, or any other map (such as a WeakHashMap)
 * where the keys satisfy k1.equals(k2) implies k1 == k2.
 * Note that all put operations MUST go through this class, 
 * because calling put on the underlying map can result in
 * the cache returning incorrect results for get.
